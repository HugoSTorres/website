When did we decide we were gonna believe everything we read on the internet?

I feel like from one day to the next we went from "You can't use Wikipedia as
a source in your essay Timmy" to "OMG Hilary Clinton eats anchovie pizza while
abusing children!"

Seriously. Stop that shit. You're ruining the internet.

Take, for example, Alex Jones.

I loved watching Alex Jones. I've soaked at least two pairs of pants while
laughing at him.

Now, I can't watch Alex Jones anymore, because some people actually thought
the shit he says is _real_.

Seriously?

Look. There's no doubt we need trustworthy news sources, but
**the internet should not be that news source.**

The internet is for _platforms_ where _everybody_ can connect and share.

Sometimes you will read things on the internet that are true. You can look up
Benjamin Franklin on Wikipedia and probably be okay believing what you read.

The vast majority of the time, you will read things on the internet that are **false**.

And that's ok. Don't take everything so seriously.

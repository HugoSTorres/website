Medium is a great site. It makes it very convinient to get up
and running with your own blog. Just because it wasn't right
for me doesn't mean it isn't right for you.

The first thing I guess I should say is that I've wanted my own
site for a while. The problem with that until recently was that
I'm a terrible designer, and I didn't want to run a heavy CMS. I
also didn't want the chore of keeping a static site up to
date by hand.

I've killed all these birds with one stone: the Hugo static site
generator. It makes it easy to add content by allowing you to
simply regenerate your site after you're done making changes.

### That being said

One thing did always bother me about Medium: it seems to put the
whining of Silicon Valley's most idealistic writers ahead of all
other content. It's not that I care about my content being seen.
I really just find it annoying when people whine about how hard
their lives are, just to try and somehow add credibility to their
humanity.

I don't have any metrics to back up my claim. I disabled my Medium
account a while ago. I just remember having to try really hard to
find anything that wasn't written in Silicon Valley or New York.
